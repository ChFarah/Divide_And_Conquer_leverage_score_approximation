"""
this code allows us to test the DAC algorithm, in the context of 
active learning. 
We use DAC to compute an approximation of the leverage score. 
We then use these scores to sample subsets of data that we use 
to train a model (here a SVM).

we repeat this experiment for several subset sizes and plot the error.
This experiment can be used to generate figure 8 of the submitted paper.
